# Undead AI

## Running the program

To run the program you just need to type "python UndeadAI.py" into the console

## Testing the program

Four test files are provided with the program:

* 4x4Easy.txt
* 5x5Easy.txt
* 4x4.txt
* 5x5.txt

To change which test file you are using just change the main function in the program to use whichever file you would like when calling the readBoard function.

You will also need to change the dim global variable to be the correct dimention. i.e. dim = 4 for the 4x4 boards and dim = 5 for the 5x5 boards.
